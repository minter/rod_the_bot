# Rod The Bot

A Bluesky bot to post in-game updates for NHL games

## About This Project

Now that my primary social media home is [Bluesky](https://bsky.app), I wanted to bring in some in-game NHL updates into the timeline. This bot leverages the [NHL StatsWeb API](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi) to pull live game data, and post updates to Bluesky.

The project leverages my previous work with a Twitter bot to post automated goal calls to Twitter. It was written to power the Carolina Hurricanes Bluesky account [@canesgameday.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/canesgameday.bsky.social), but should be configurable for accounts following any NHL team.

## Installation

You can install and run raw source code on your server, or use the Docker image.

By default, the scheduler will run at 10am in your time zone every day. If there is no game that day, it will silently exit. If there is a game, it will enqueue the game feed job to run every minute until the game is marked as a final. Once the game is final, it will enqueue the post-game job to run once.

### Raw source code

This method requires you to be running on a system with Ruby 3+ and enough dev tools to build native extensions. You will also need a Redis instance running to store state.

1. Clone the repo from GitHub: [minter/rod_the_bot](https://github.com/minter/rod_the_bot)
2. Install Ruby dependencies: `bundle install`
3. Create a `.env` file (see below)
4. Run the background job processor: `bundle exec dotenv sidekiq`
5. Optional - Run the web UI to monitor Sidekiq: `bin/rails s`

### Docker image

This method requires you to have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

1. Clone the repo from GitHub: [minter/rod_the_bot](https://github.com/minter/rod_the_bot)
2. Create a `.env` file (see below)
3. Run the software: `docker-compose up --build -d`

## Configuration using .env

Rod The Bot is managed by system environment variables, stored in a file named `.env` in the root of the project. You must create one of these with the appropriate values for your environment. An example file is provided below:

```
BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD=YOUR APP PASSWORD
BLUESKY_ENABLED=true
BLUESKY_URL=https://bsky.social
BLUESKY_USERNAME=YOUR_USERNAME.bsky.social
DEBUG_POSTS=false
NHL_TEAM_ID=12
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/9
TEAM_HASHTAGS="#LetsGoCanes #CauseChaos"
TIME_ZONE=America/New_York
WEB_PORT=3000
WIN_CELEBRATION=Canes Win!
```
You can, in theory, pass the environment variables to the system in other ways, but those methods are not covered here.

### BLUESKY_USERNAME and BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD

These are the credentials for the Bluesky account that you want to post to. You can find your app password in the [Bluesky settings](https://bsky.social/settings/apps). Note that when you create an app password, you will only be shown the password once. If you lose it, you will need to create a new one.

### BLUESKY_ENABLED

This setting controls whether Rod The Bot will actually post to Bluesky. If you want to test the bot without posting, set this to `false`.

### BLUESKY_URL

This is the URL of the Bluesky instance that you want to post to. The recommended value is the main Bluesky instance at https://bsky.social. If you are running your own instance, you can use that URL instead.

### DEBUG_POSTS

This setting controls whether Rod The Bot will print the post text to the console. This is useful for testing, but should be set to `false` in production unless you need to inspect posts for errors.

### NHL_TEAM_ID

Every NHL franchise has an ID in the stats system. This is used to identify the team that you want to follow, and unlocks happy posts when something good happens to your team. IDs for all active NHL teams can be found in this table:

| Team Name             | Team ID |
| --------------------- | ------- |
| Anaheim Ducks         | 24      |
| Arizona Coyotes       | 53      |
| Boston Bruins         | 6       |
| Buffalo Sabres        | 7       |
| Calgary Flames        | 20      |
| Carolina Hurricanes   | 12      |
| Chicago Blackhawks    | 16      |
| Colorado Avalanche    | 21      |
| Columbus Blue Jackets | 29      |
| Dallas Stars          | 25      |
| Detroit Red Wings     | 17      |
| Edmonton Oilers       | 22      |
| Florida Panthers      | 13      |
| Los Angeles Kings     | 26      |
| Minnesota Wild        | 30      |
| Montr√©al Canadiens    | 8       |
| Nashville Predators   | 18      |
| New Jersey Devils     | 1       |
| New York Islanders    | 2       |
| New York Rangers      | 3       |
| Ottawa Senators       | 9       |
| Philadelphia Flyers   | 4       |
| Pittsburgh Penguins   | 5       |
| St. Louis Blues       | 19      |
| San Jose Sharks       | 28      |
| Seattle Kraken        | 55      |
| Tampa Bay Lightning   | 14      |
| Toronto Maple Leafs   | 10      |
| Vancouver Canucks     | 23      |
| Vegas Golden Knights  | 54      |
| Washington Capitals   | 15      |
| Winnipeg Jets         | 52      |

### REDIS_URL

Rod The Bot uses Redis to keep track of plays that it has already seen. This is used to prevent duplicate posts. You can use any Redis instance that you want, but the default is to use a local instance on port 6379, database 9. If you are using the docker-compose method, this will be overridden in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### TEAM_HASHTAGS

This setting controls the hashtags that will be added to each post. You can add as many as you want, but they must be separated by spaces. You can use this if your team has official hashtags that you would like to include on every post.

### TIME_ZONE

The NHL Stats API returns all times in UTC. This setting is used to convert those times to your local time zone. The time zone must be specified in the Rails-style format like `America/New_York`, not `EDT` or other formats. You can find a list of valid time zone names [here](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/TimeZone.html).

Common time zones:
* Eastern Time: `America/New_York`
* Central Time: `America/Chicago`
* Mountain Time: `America/Denver`
* Pacific Time: `America/Los_Angeles`
* Arizona Time: `America/Phoenix`


### WEB_PORT

This setting controls the port that the web UI will listen on. This is only used if you are running the web UI.

### WIN_CELEBRATION

If this is set, the value provided will be put at the top of your final score post if your team wins!
